# Introduction - Stack
A member of the category of linear data structures, the stack is a collection of elements whose principal operations ***PUSH*** and ***POP*** follow a ***LiFo (Last in First Out)*** approach.

A stack can be implemented using either a linked list or an Array.

# Implementation code
I made 3 implementation of a stack using a list, collections.deque and queue.LifoQueue

# Introduction - Queue
A member of the category of linear data structures, the queue is a collection of elements whose principal operations ***PUSH*** and ***POP*** follow a ***FiFo (First in First Out)*** approach.

A queue can be implemented using either a linked list or an Array.
